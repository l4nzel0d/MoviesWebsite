                            <strong>UPDATED:</strong> Storming 63 international
                            box office markets in its opening frame, and before
                            domestic enters the arena this coming week,
                            Paramount and Ridley Scott’s Gladiator II has
                            debuted to an estimated <strong>$87M</strong>. This
                            is within our pre-release projection, and also marks
                            the biggest overseas start for a Ridley
                            Scott-directed film, as well as Paramount’s best
                            offshore bow for a U.S. R-rated movie. Heading back
                            to the Colosseum 24 years after Best Picture Oscar
                            winner Gladiator reinvented the swords and sandals
                            genre, this sequel was No. 1 in major markets. It
                            performed best in the UK with a No. 1 launch of
                            $11.4M at 722 locations.

                            Next up was France at $10.3M from 729 sites. Spain
                            grossed $5.6M from 411, Australia delivered $4.9M at
                            353, and Mexico chimed in with $4.7M from 922.
                            Elsewhere among No. 1s, Germany’s start was $4.3M
                            from 650 locations, Italy grossed $3.8M at 530,
                            Korea did $3.2M from 545 and Brazil was good for $3M
                            from 759 sites. All of this is ahead of the domestic
                            (and China) release on November 22. We’ll get into
                            more detail on the Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Denzel
                            Washington and Connie Nielsen-starrer in just a bit
                            (see below for how marketing and partnerships helped
                            amp the film). In the meantime, Sony’s Venom: The
                            Last Dance, after topping $400M global earlier this
                            week, has now surpassed the international lifetime
                            of Venom: Let There Be Carnage. The offshore cume is
                            $308.5M coming off of a $17.3M weekend in 66
                            overseas markets (-49% from last session).
                            Worldwide, the cume is now $436.1M.

                        <p>
                            Here are the Top 5 international markets to date:
                            China ($90.3M), Mexico ($18.8M), UK ($15.3M),
                            Germany ($13.1M) and Korea ($12.1M). Last weekend’s
                            new entry, Red One, added an estimated $14.7M from
                            the sophomore overseas session. Recall this is a
                            Warner Bros release overseas whereas Amazon MGM just
                            put it out domestically this frame. The drop
                            internationally was 43% and the running offshore
                            cume is $50M, for $84M global. Internationally,
                            there were some really strong holds on this Dwayne
                            Johnson/Chris Evans-starrer, including Brazil (-8%),
                            Germany (-9%), New Zealand (-14%), Switzerland
                            (-18%), Austria (-22%), Peru (-23%), Holland (-26%),
                            UK (-28%), Spain (-31%), Singapore (-31%), Italy
                            (-32%), Australia (-35%), Colombia (-38%) and
                            Malaysia (-39%).

                            Studiocanal’s Paddington in Peru, which last weekend
                            scored the biggest opening of the year for a
                            British-produced movie in the UK & Ireland,
                            continued to charm audiences there with another
                            $8.7M (-29%). That takes its local cume to $23.7M,
                            and puts it at No. 9 of all films in the market to
                            date this year. Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s
                            charmer The Wild Robot, which, as we reported on
                            Saturday, has passed $300M worldwide, added $6M this
                            frame (-35% versus last weekend). The international
                            cume through Sunday is $170.7M for $308.5M global.

                        <p>
                            Uplift and strong holds were seen in several
                            markets. Spain had the best performance in Week 6,
                            now tallying $10M as The Wild Robot passed the
                            lifetimes of How To Train Your Dragon 2 and HTTYD3.
                            There was another red alert for weather in the
                            Valencia region during the week, but the strong
                            play-out is aided by an excellent FilmAffinity score
                            (7.9), the highest ever for a DWA film. Tops is
                            still Mexico, now with $20M, followed by the UK at
                            $17M and France at $12.4M. Digging back into G2,
                            prior to the international release, the cast and
                            filmmakers embarked on a global tour that spanned
                            seven countries across four continents, including
                            events in London, Sydney, Tokyo, Dublin, Copenhagen
                            and Paris. There were also a number of key
                            partnerships. Highlights from the marketing campaign
                            and partnerships include PepsiCo’s cookie brand
                            Emperador, which launched a multi-million-dollar
                            bespoke TV campaign in Mexico and featured a
                            Colosseum-inspired takeover of the Oxxo flagship
                            store in Mexico City.
