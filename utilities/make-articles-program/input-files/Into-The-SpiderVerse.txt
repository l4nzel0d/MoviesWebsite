‘Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse’ Sequel Gets Release Date

Sony said Friday that the sequel to its Oscar-winning animated pic Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse will hit theaters on April 8, 2022. The studio also said that another Sony Pictures Animation project — the musical adventure tale Vivo, with original songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda — is being pushed back five months to April 2021.

The original Marvel/Columbia Pictures movie from Sony Pictures Animation with technical wizardry was released in December, grossing $190 million domestically and $375.M globally, with its take on Marvel’s most esteemed superhero eventually earning the Animated Feature Oscar after sweeping the Annie Awards.

Into the Spider-Verse producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are back to produce the follow-up after the first film, which was made on a $90 million production budget. It has been hailed widely as a bold, fresh and evocative new approach to animation filmmaking thanks to its retro, hand-drawn spirit and Lord and Miller’s eagerness to reinvent the standard industry animation approach, which had, in their view, created a flat and homogenized predictability to Hollywood releases in recent years.

Miller helped get the news out about the sequel today.

Vivo previously had been set for release ob November 6, 2020, that after it was originally slated for December 2020.

First set at DreamWorks Animation, the story centers on a capuchin monkey with a thirst for adventure – and a passion for music – who makes a treacherous passage from Havana to Miami to fulfill his destiny. Quiara Alegría Hudes, Miranda’s collaborator on In the Heights, wrote the script and The Croods helmer Kirk De Micco is directing.
